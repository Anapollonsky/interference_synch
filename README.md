# interference_synch
Summary
=======
This repo stores the code from my Master's project. There's a lot of stuff here that I'm too lazy to organize -- basically, iterations are chronological divisions of my efforts, with the earlier iterations generally being simple communications simulations and later ones including genetic algorithms, synchronization, MIMO simulations, plotting, the whole shebang.
